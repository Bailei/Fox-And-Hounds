Welcome to game Halatafl
========
**Introduction:**
Halatafl means "tail board", in Old Norse, and "tail" presumably refers to a fox's tail. As in modern Swedish for "the Fox game".

There are two fox pegs (the red pegs on the picture) and 20 sheep pegs (the yellow pegs). The objective is for the sheep to reach a certain destination on the board, the square of nine holes marked with dark green, and it is the foxes' objective to stop the defender from reaching it. The foxes are placed in the corners on the bottom of the the paddock area, whereas the sheep are placed on the opposite side of the board. 

**Rules:**
Foxes can move in any direction along the game board`s grid lines. The goal is to catch 12 sheep and prevent them from filling the paddock area(dark green). To catch a sheep, jump over them like in checkers, one or more times. Foxes must jump if they can. 
 
Sheep can move only sideways and forwards but not backwards or diagonally forwards. The goal is to get 9 sheep into the paddock area(dark green), avoid the mean foxes!
