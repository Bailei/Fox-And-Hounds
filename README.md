Welcome to game Halatafl
========
**Introduction:**

Halatafl means "tail board", in Old Norse, and "tail" presumably refers to a fox's tail. As in modern Swedish for "the Fox game".(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_games)

There are two fox and 20 sheep. The objective is for the sheep to reach a certain destination on the board, the square of nine holes marked with dark green, and it is the foxes' objective to stop the sheep from reaching it. 

**Rules:**

Foxes can move in any direction along the game board`s grid lines. The goal is to catch 12 sheep and prevent them from filling the paddock area(dark green). To catch a sheep, jump over them like in checkers, one or more times. Foxes must jump if they can. 
 
Sheep can move only sideways and forwards. The goal is to get 9 sheep into the paddock area, avoid the mean foxes!
